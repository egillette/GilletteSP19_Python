    "We know that the error on a measurement tool is typically given as it's tolerance, and the error on several repeated measurements can be given as a standard deviation, or a condfidence interval. But what do we do when a final answer in a calculation requires mathematical processing of multiple numbers, with multiple different types of error involved?\n",
    "\n",
    "Titrations are an excellent example of this challenge. If we hope to determine the concentration of an unknown by titration, what steps must we take? Imagine the titrations you did in experiment # 3 to determine the concentration of an unknown solution of NaOH using Tris. How many different meaured values had to be considered as part of that calculation?\n",

    "First let's just consider what you needed to get the final volume dispensed by the buret:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initial volume on the buret (+/- tolerance of the buret)\n",
    "2. Final volume on the buret (+/- tolerance of the buret)\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the total volume, you probably just subtracted:  $ V_{total} = V_{final} - V_{initial} $ so to propagate the error, we use the rules for addition and subtraction\n",

    "$$ error_{Vtotal} = \\sqrt { error_{Vfinal}^{2} + error_{Vinitial}^{2}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Be careful to note that this equation is absolute error, so it has the units of the measured value! This means if you convert the measured values into a different unit, be sure to convert the absolute error as well. For example, the tolerance on a 10 mL buret is +/- 0.02 mL or the tolerance on a 0.010 L buret is +/- 0.00002 L. Note however, that in relative terms, both of these tolerances are +/- 0.2 % if expressed as relative errors.\n",
